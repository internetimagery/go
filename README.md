# GO

The classic game of Go (Baduk) in the browser.

A simple no nonsense Go board.

* Play with your friends on the same computer.
* Play any (practical) size board. Just add the number to the end of the URL (ie #009 , #013 , #019)
* Make a move. Copy the URL and paste it into your favourite message service (forum / email / etc) to share your game.
* Use your browsers Back / Forward buttons to follow the games progress.
* Drag / Drop a game SGF file onto the board to view that game.
