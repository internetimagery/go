# GO

The classic game of Go (Baduk) in the browser.

A simple no nonsense Go board.

* Play with your friends on the same computer.
* Play any (practical) size board. Move the slider below the board to pick a size.
* Make a move. Copy the URL and paste it into your favourite message service (forum / email / etc) to share your game.
* Re-watch the game using the same (repurposed) slider, above. Or use the left/right arrow keys.
* Drag / Drop a game SGF file onto the board to view that game.
